```javascript
// Ensure Tailwind directives are correctly added to your CSS file (e.g., tailwind.css).
/** @tailwind base */
/** @tailwind components */
/** @tailwind utilities */

//Verify correct Tailwind configuration in your main app file (e.g., app.js or main.js). 
// This may involve importing tailwind or checking the webpack configurations

// Ensure that your build process is configured to correctly process Tailwind directives.
// This often involves using PostCSS to handle the directives.

// Check for conflicting CSS rules that might override Tailwind styles.
// If there are external style sheets linked, make sure that Tailwind CSS is included after them to apply the styles correctly.
// Add !important (although not recommended as a long-term solution) if absolutely needed to ensure that Tailwind styles are applied on top.
<div class="bg-red-500 hover:bg-blue-700 p-4 !important">
  Hover over me!
