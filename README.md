# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applied Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue where Tailwind CSS classes fail to apply to HTML elements, even when the framework is correctly set up.

## Bug Description

The problem is that certain Tailwind CSS utility classes don't render as expected in the browser despite being correctly added to HTML elements.  This might result from various causes such as configuration errors, missing build steps, or conflicts with other CSS styles.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the development server (instructions may vary based on the project setup, for example using `npm run dev`)
3. Open the browser and observe that Tailwind classes are not rendered correctly.

## Solution

The solution typically involves double-checking the Tailwind configuration files and build process to ensure the necessary steps are performed correctly.  Also ensure no CSS conflicts are present.
